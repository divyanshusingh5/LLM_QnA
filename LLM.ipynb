Why do we\\nstart by talking of\\nthis?\\nEthnic :  A social\\ndivision based on\\nshared culture. People\\nbelonging to the same\\nethnic group believe in\\ntheir common descent\\nbecause of similarities\\nof physical type or of\\nculture or both. They\\nneed not always have\\nthe same religion or\\nnationality.Communities\\nand\\nregions of\\nBelgiumBelgium is a small country in Europe,\\nsmaller in area than the state of\\nHaryana. It has borders with\\nNetherlands, France and Germany. It\\nhas a population of  a little over one\\ncrore, about half  the population of\\nHaryana. The ETHNIC  composition of\\nthis small country is very complex. Of\\nthe country’s total population, 59 per\\ncent lives in the Flemish region and\\nspeaks Dutch language. Another 40 per\\ncent people live in the Wallonia region\\nand speak French. Remaining 1 per cent\\nof  the Belgians speak German. In the\\ncapital city Brussels, 80 per cent people\\nspeak French while 20 per cent are\\nDutch-speaking.\\nThe minority French-speaking\\ncommunity was relatively rich and\\npowerful. This was resented by the\\nDutch-speaking community who got\\nthe benefit of  economic developmentand education much later. This led to\\ntensions between the Dutch-speaking\\nand French-speaking communities\\nduring the 1950s and 1960s. The\\ntension between the two communities\\nwas more acute in Brussels. Brussels\\npresented a special problem: the\\nDutch-speaking people constituted a\\nmajority in the country, but a minority\\nin the capital.\\nLet us compare this to the situation\\nin another country. Sri Lanka is an\\nisland nation, just a few kilometres off\\nthe southern coast of  Tamil Nadu. It\\nhas about 2 crore people, about the\\nsame as in Haryana. Like other nations\\nin the South Asia region, Sri Lanka has\\na diverse population. The major social\\ngroups are the Sinhala-speakers (74 per\\ncent) and the Tamil-speakers (18 per\\ncent). Among Tamils there are two sub-\\ngroups.

The rest, whose forefathers came\\nfrom India as plantation workers during\\ncolonial period, are called ‘Indian\\nTamils’. As you can see from the map,\\nSri Lankan Tamils are concentrated in\\nthe north and east of  the country. Most\\nof the Sinhala-speaking people are\\nBuddhist, while most of  the Tamils are\\nHindus or Muslims. There are about 7\\nper cent Christians, who are both Tamil\\nand Sinhala.\\nJust imagine what could happen\\nin situations like this. In Belgium, theDutch community could take\\nadvantage of  its numeric majority and\\nforce its will on the French and\\nGerman-speaking population. This\\nwould push the conflict among\\ncommunities further. This could  lead\\nto a very messy partition of  the\\ncountry; both the sides would claim\\ncontrol over Brussels. In Sri Lanka, the\\nSinhala community enjoyed an even\\nbigger majority and could impose its\\nwill on the entire country. Now, let us\\nlook at what happened in both these\\ncountries.▼ ✟ ✠ ✡ ☛ ☞ ✌ ✟ ☛ ☞ ✟ ✍ ☞ ✎✏ ☞ ✍ ✑ ☛ ☞ ✒ ✟ ✍ ✓ ✟\\nSri Lanka emerged as an independent\\ncountry in 1948. The leaders of the\\nSinhala community sought to secure\\ndominance over government by virtue\\nof  their majority. As a result, the\\ndemocratically elected government\\nadopted a series of  MAJORITARIAN\\nmeasures to establish Sinhala supremacy.\\nIn 1956, an Act was passed to\\nrecognise Sinhala as the only official\\nlanguage, thus disregarding Tamil. The\\ngovernments followed preferential\\npolicies that favoured Sinhala\\napplicants for university positions and\\ngovernment jobs. A new constitution\\nstipulated that the state shall protect\\nand foster Buddhism.\\nAll these government measures,\\ncoming one after the other, gradually\\nincreased the feeling of alienation\\namong the Sri Lankan Tamils.

They recognised the existence of\\nregional differences and cultural\\ndiversities. Between 1970 and 1993,\\nthey amended their constitution four\\ntimes so as to work out an arrangement\\nthat would enable everyone to live\\ntogether within the same country. The\\narrangement they worked out is\\ndifferent from any other country and\\nis very innovative. Here are some of\\nthe elements of the Belgian model:✠ Constitution prescribes that the\\nnumber of  Dutc h and French-speaking\\nministers shall be equal in the central\\ngovernment. Some special laws require\\nthe support of  majority of  members\\nfrom each linguistic group. Thus, no\\nWhat’s wrong if\\nthe m ajority\\ncom m unity\\nrules?

But their demand for more\\nautonomy to provinces populated by\\nthe Tamils was repeatedly denied. By\\n1980s several political organisations\\nwere formed demanding an\\nindependent Tamil Eelam (state) in\\nnorthern and eastern parts of  Sri Lanka.The distrust between the two\\ncommunities turned into widespread\\nconflict. It soon turned into a CIVIL WAR.\\nAs a result thousands of people of both\\nthe communities have been killed. Many\\nfamilies were forced to leave the country\\nas refugees and many more lost their\\nlivelihoods.

Both are\\ndemocracies. Yet, they dealt with the\\nquestion of  power sharing differently.\\nIn Belgium, the leaders have realised\\nthat the unity of  the country is possible\\nonly by respecting the feelings and\\ninterests of different communities andregions. Such a realisation resulted in\\nmutually acceptable arrangements for\\nsharing power. Sri Lanka shows us a\\ncontrasting example. It shows us that\\nif  a majority community wants to force\\nits dominance over others and refuses\\nto share power, it can undermine the\\nunity of  the country.\\nEuropean Union Parliament in BelgiumApart from the Central and\\nthe State Government, there is a\\nthird kind of  government. This\\n‘community government’ is elected by\\npeople belonging to one language\\ncommunity – Dutch, French and\\nGerman-speaking – no matter where\\nthey live. This government has the\\npower regarding cultural, educational\\nand language-related issues.\\nYou might find the Belgian model\\nvery complicated. It indeed is very\\ncomplicated, even for people living in\\nBelgium. But these arrangements have\\nworked well so far. They helped to\\navoid civic strife between the two\\nmajor communities and a possible\\ndivision of  the country on linguistic\\nlines.

And why?Why power sharing is desirable?\\nThus, two different sets of  reasons can\\nbe given in favour of  power sharing.\\nFirstly, power sharing is good because\\nit helps to reduce the possibility of\\nconflict between social groups. Since\\nsocial conflict often leads to violence\\nand political instability, power sharing\\nis a good way to ensure the stability of\\npolitical order. Imposing the will of\\nmajority community over others may\\nlook like an attractive option in the\\nshort run, but in the long run it\\nundermines the unity of  the nation.Tyranny of  the majority is not just\\noppressive for the minority; it often\\nbrings ruin to the majority as well.\\nThere is a second, deeper reason\\nwhy power sharing is good for\\ndemocracies. Power sharing is the very\\nspirit of  democracy. A democratic rule\\ninvolves sharing power with those\\naffected by its exercise, and who have\\nto live with its effects. People have a\\nright to be consulted on how they are\\nto be governed. A legitimate\\ngovernment is one where citizens,\\nthrough participation, acquire a stake\\nin the system.\\nLet us call the first set of reasons\\nPRUDENTIAL  and the second moral. While\\nprudential reasons stress that power\\nsharing will bring out better outcomes,\\nmoral reasons emphasises the very act\\nof power sharing as valuable.\\nPrudential:  Based on\\nprudence, or on careful\\ncalculation of gains and\\nlosses. Prudential decisions\\nare usually contrasted with\\nthose decisions based\\npurely on moral\\nconsiderations.\\nThe cartoon at the left refers to the\\nproblems of running the Germany’s grand\\ncoalition government that include the two\\nmajor parties of the country, namely the\\nChristian Democratic Union and the\\nSocial Democratic Party. The two parties\\nare historically rivals to each other. They\\nhave to form a coalition government\\nbecause neither of them got clear majority\\nof seats on their own in the 2005\\nelections. They take divergent positions\\non several policy matters, but still jointly\\nrun the government.©  Tab -  The Calgary Sun , Cagle Cartoons Inc.P♦\\x00✁✂✄❤☎✂✆✝✞7\\nAs usual, Vikram ’s was driving the m otorbike under a vow\\nof silence and Vetal was the pillion rider.  As usu al, Vetal\\nstarted telling Vikram  a story to keep him  awake wh ile\\ndriving. This tim e the story went as follows:\\n“I n the city of Beirut there lived a m an called Kha lil. His parents\\ncam e from  different com m unities.  His father was an  Orthodox Christian and m other a\\nSunni Muslim . This was not so uncom m on in this m ode rn, cosm opolitan city. People\\nfrom  various com m unities that lived in Lebanon cam e  to live in its capital, Beirut. They\\nlived together, interm ingled, yet fought a bitter c ivil war am ong them selves. One of\\nKhalil’s uncles was killed in that war.\\nAt the end of this civil war, Lebanon’s leaders cam e together and agreed to som e basic\\nrules for power sharing am ong different com m unities . As per these rules the country’s\\nPresident m ust belong to the Maronite sect of Catho lic Christians. The Prim e Minister\\nm ust be from  the Sunni Muslim  com m unity. The post o f Deputy Prim e Minister is fixed for\\nOrthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for  Shi’a Muslim . Under this pact, the\\nChristians agreed not to seek French protection and  the Muslim  agreed not to seek\\nunification with the neighbouring state of Syria.Wh en the Christians and Muslim s cam e to\\nthis agreem ent, they were nearly equal in populatio n. Both sides have continued to\\nrespect this agreem ent though now the Muslim s are i n clear m ajority.\\nKhalil does not like this system  one bit. He is a p opular m an with political am bition. But\\nunder the present system  the top position is out of  his reach barred from  him . He does\\nnot practice either his father’s or his m other’s re ligion and does not wish to be known\\nby either. He cannot understand why Lebanon can’t b e like any other ‘norm al’\\ndem ocracy. “Just hold an election, allow everyone t o contest and whoever wins\\nm axim um  votes becom es the president, no m atter whic h com m unity he com es from .\\nWhy can’t we do that, like in other dem ocracies of the world?” he asks.

Vetal\\nwrapped up quickly and posed his\\ncustom ary question to Vikram :  “I f you had\\nthe power to rewrite the rules in Lebanon,\\nwhat would you do? Would you adopt the\\n‘regular’ rules followed everywhere, as Khalil\\nsuggests? Or stick to the old rules?

During the same time the US president visited Russia.\\nWhat, according to this cartoon, is the relationship between democracy\\nand concentration of power? Can you think of some other examples to\\nillustrate the point being made here?The idea of  power sharing has\\nemerged in opposition to the notions\\nof  undivided political power. For a\\nlong time it was believed that all power\\nof  a government must reside in one\\nperson or group of  persons located\\nat one place. It was felt that if  the\\npower to decide is dispersed, it would\\nnot be possible to take quick decisions\\nand to enforce them. But these\\nnotions have changed with the\\nemergence of  democracy. One basic\\nprinciple of democracy is that people\\nare the source of  all political power.\\nIn a democracy, people rule\\nthemselves through institutions of\\nself-governance. In a good democratic\\ngovernment, due respect is given to\\ndiverse groups and views that exist in\\na society. Everyone has a voice in the\\nshaping of  public policies. Therefore,\\nit follows that in a democracy political\\n❋ ✠ ✡ ☛ ☞ ✠ ✌ ✍ ✠ ✎ ✏ ✡ ☞ ✑ ✒ ✡ ✓ ✔ ✕\\npower should be distributed among\\nas many citizens as possible.\\nIn modern democracies,  power\\nsharing arrangements can take many\\nforms. Let us look at some of  the most\\ncommon arrangements that we have\\nor will come across.\\n1 Power is shared among dif ferent\\norgans of  government, such as the\\nlegislature, executive and judiciary. Let\\nus call this horizontal distribution of\\npower because it allows different organs\\nof government placed at the same level\\nto exercise different powers. Such a\\nseparation ensures that none of  the\\norgans can exercise unlimited power.\\nEach organ checks the others. This\\nresults in a balance of  power among\\nvarious institutions. Last year we studied\\nthat in a democracy, even though\\nministers and government officials\\nexercise power, they are responsible to\\nthe Parliament or State Assemblies.\\nSimilarly, although judges are appointed\\nby the executive, they can check the\\nfunctioning of executive or laws made\\nby the legislatures. This arrangement is\\ncalled a system of  checks and balances.\\n2Power can be shared  among\\ngovernments at different levels –  a\\ngeneral government for the entire\\ncountry and governments at the\\nprovincial or regional level. Such a\\ngeneral government for the entire\\ncountry is usually called federal\\ngovernment. In India, we refer to it\\nas the Central or Union Go vernment.\\nThe governments at the provincial or\\nregional level are called by different\\nnames in different countries. In India,Reigning Reins©  Olle Johansson - Sweden, Cagle Cartoons Inc.P♦\\x00✁✂✄❤☎✂✆✝✞9\\nI n my school, the\\nclass m onitor\\nchanges every\\nm onth. I s that\\nwhat you call a\\npower sharing\\narrangem ent?we call them State Governments. This\\nsystem is not followed in all countries.\\nThere are many countries where there\\nare no provincial or state\\ngovernments. But in those countries\\nlike ours, where there are different\\nlevels of  governments, the\\nconstitution clearly lays down the\\npowers of  different levels of\\ngovernment. This is what they did in\\nBelgium, but was refused in Sri Lanka.\\nThis is called federal division  of\\npower. The same principle can be\\nextended to levels of  government\\nlower than the State government, such\\nas the municipality and panchayat. Let\\nus call division of  powers involving\\nhigher and lower levels of\\ngovernment vertical division of\\npower. We shall study these at some\\nlength in the next chapter.\\n3Power may also be shared  among\\ndifferent social g roups, such as the\\nreligious and linguistic groups.\\n‘Community government’ in Belgium\\nis a good example of  this arrangement.\\nIn some countries there are\\nconstitutional and legal arrangements\\nwhereby socially weaker sections and\\nwomen are represented in the\\nlegislatures and administration. Last\\nyear we studied the system of  ‘reserved\\nconstituencies’ in assemblies and the\\nparliament of  our country. This type\\nof  arrangement is meant to give space\\nin the government and administration\\nto diverse social groups who otherwisewould feel alienated from the\\ngovernment. This method is used to\\ngive minority communities a fair share\\nin power. In Chapter 3, we shall look\\nat various ways  of accommodating\\nsocial diversities.\\n4Power sharing arrangements can\\nalso be seen in the w ay political\\nparties, pressure groups and\\nmovements control or influence those\\nin power. In a democracy, the citizens\\nmust have freedom to choose among\\nvarious contenders for power. In\\ncontemporary democracies this takes\\nthe form of  competition among\\ndifferent parties. Such competition\\nensures that power does not remain in\\none hand. In the long run power is\\nshared among different political parties\\nthat represent different ideologies and\\nsocial groups. Sometimes this kind of\\nsharing can be direct, when two or\\nmore parties form an alliance to\\ncontest elections. If  their alliance is\\nelected, they form a coalition\\ngovernment and thus share power. In\\na democracy, we find interest groups\\nsuch as those of  traders, businessmen,\\nindustrialists, farmers and industrial\\nworkers. They also will have a share in\\ngovernmental power, either through\\nparticipation in governmental\\ncommittees or bringing influence on\\nthe decision making process. In\\nChapter 4, we shall study the working\\nof  political parties, pressure groups and\\nsocial movements.10\\n❉\\x00✁✂✄☎❛✆✝✄✞✂♦✝✆✝✄✟\\nHere are som e exam ples of power sharing.

You would recall that\\none of  the key changes made in the\\nConstitution of  Belgium was to reduce\\nthe power of  the Central Government\\nand to give these powers to the regional\\ngovernments. Regional governments\\nexisted in Belgium even earlier. They\\nhad their roles and powers. But all these\\npowers were given to these\\ngovernments and could be withdrawn\\nby the Central Government. The\\nchange that took place in 1993 was that\\nthe regional governments were given\\nconstitutional powers that were no\\nlonger dependent on the central\\ngovernment. Thus, Belgium shifted\\nfrom a unitary to a federal form of\\ngovernment. Sri Lanka continues to be,for all practical purposes, a unitary\\nsystem where the national government\\nhas all the powers. Tamil leaders want\\nSri Lanka to become a federal system.\\nFederalism is a system of\\ngovernment in which the power is\\ndivided between a central authority and\\nvarious constituent units of  the\\ncountry. Usually, a federation has two\\nlevels of  government. One is the\\ngovernment for the entire country that\\nis usually responsible for a few subjects\\nof  common national interest. The\\nothers are governments at the level of\\nprovinces or states that look after\\nmuch of  the day-to-day administering\\nof  their state. Both these levels of\\ngovernments enjoy their power\\nindependent of  the other.\\nI  am  confused.\\nWhat do we call\\nthe I ndian\\ngovernm ent? I s\\nit Union, Federal\\nor Central?\\nThough only 25 of the world’s 192 countries have federal political systems, their citizens make up 40 per cent of\\nthe world’s population. Most of the large countries of the world are federations. Can you notice an exception to this\\nrule in this map?\\nSource: Montreal and Kingston,  Handbook of Federal Countries: 2002 , McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2002.Federal\\npolitical systems\\nCanada\\nUnited States\\nof America\\nMexico\\nPACIFIC OCEAN\\nMicronesia\\nArgentinaVenezuela\\nATLANTIC\\nOCEAN BrazilSt. Kitts\\nand NevisBelgium\\nSwitzerland\\nSpain\\nNigeria\\nEthiopia\\nComorosBosnia and\\nHerzegovinaAustria\\nPakistanRussia\\nIndia\\nMalaysia\\nAustraliaINDIAN\\nOCEAN\\nSouth AfricaPACIFIC OCEAN\\nUnited\\nArab\\nEmiratesGermany❋❡\\x00❡✁❛✂✄s♠15\\nJurisdiction:  The area\\nover which someone\\nhas legal authority. The\\narea may be defined in\\nterms of  geographical\\nboundaries or in terms\\nof certain kinds of\\nsubjects.7The federal system thus has dual\\nobjectives: to safeguard and promote\\nunity of  the country, while at the same\\ntime accommodate regional diversity.\\nTherefore, two aspects are crucial for\\nthe institutions and practice of\\nfederalism. Governments at different\\nlevels should agree to some rules of\\npower sharing. They should also trust\\nthat each would abide by its part of\\nthe agreement. An ideal federal system\\nhas both aspects : mutual trust and\\nagreement to live together.\\nThe exact balance of power\\nbetween the central and the state\\ngovernment varies from one federation\\nto another.  This balance depends\\nmainly on the historical context in which\\nthe federation was formed. There are\\ntwo kinds of  routes through which\\nfederations have been formed. The first\\nroute involves independent States\\ncoming together on their own to form\\na bigger unit, so that by pooling\\nsovereignity and retaining identity they\\ncan increase their security. This type of\\n‘coming together’ federations include\\nthe USA, Switzerland and Australia. In\\nthis first category of  federations, all the\\nconstituent States usually have equal\\npower and are strong vis-à-vis the\\nfederal government.\\nThe second route is where a large\\ncountry decides to divide its power\\nbetween the constituent States and the\\nnational government. India, Spain and\\nBelgium are examples of this kind of\\n‘holding together’ federations. In\\nthis second category, the central\\ngovernment tends to be more powerful\\nvis-à-vis the States. Very often different\\nconstituent units of  the federation have\\nunequal powers. Some units are\\ngranted special powers.\\nI f federalism\\nworks only in big\\ncountries, why\\ndid Belgium\\nadopt it?In this sense, federations are\\ncontrasted with unitary governments.\\nUnder the unitary system, either there\\nis only one level of  government or the\\nsub-units are subordinate to the central\\ngovernment. The central government\\ncan pass on orders to the provincial or\\nthe local government. But in a federal\\nsystem, the central government cannot\\norder the state government to do\\nsomething. State government has\\npowers of  its own for which it is not\\nanswerable to the central government.\\nBoth these governments are separately\\nanswerable to the people.\\nLet us look at some of the key\\nfeatures of federalism :\\n1There are two or more levels (or\\ntiers) of  government.\\n2Different tiers of  government\\ngovern the same citizens, but each tier\\nhas its own JURISDICTION  in specific\\nmatters of legislation, taxation and\\nadministration.\\n3The jurisdictions of  the respective\\nlevels or tiers of  government are\\nspecified in the constitution. So the\\nexistence and authority of  each tier of\\ngovernment is constitutionally\\nguaranteed.\\n4The fundamental provisions of\\nthe constitution cannot be unilaterally\\nchanged b y one level of  government.\\nSuch changes require the consent of\\nboth the levels of  government.\\n5Courts have the power to interpret\\nthe constitution and the po wers of\\ndifferent levels of  government. The\\nhighest court acts as an umpire if\\ndisputes arise between different levels\\nof  government in the exercise of  their\\nrespective powers.\\n6Sources of revenue for each level\\nof government are clearly specified to\\nensure its financial autonomy.16\\n❉\\x00✁✂✄☎❛✆✝✄✞✂♦✝✆✝✄✟\\nI sn’t that\\nstrange?

We can\\nsee that all these features apply to the\\nprovisions of  the Indian Constitution.\\nThe Constitution originally provided\\nfor a two-tier system of  government,\\nthe Union Government or what we call\\nthe Central Government, representingthe Union of India and the State\\ngovernments. Later, a third tier of\\nfederalism was added in the form of\\nPanchayats and Municipalities. As in\\nany federation, these different tiers\\nenjoy separate jurisdiction.  The\\nConstitution clearly provided a three-\\nfold distribution of  legislative powers\\nbetween the Union Government and\\nthe State Governments. Thus, it\\ncontains three lists:✠Union List includes subjects of\\nnational impor tance such as defence\\nof  the country, foreign affairs, banking,\\ncommunications and currency.

Or subjects\\nlike computer software that came up\\nafter the constitution was made?\\nAccording to our constitution, the\\nUnion Government has the power to\\nlegislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects.\\nWe noted above that most\\nfederations that are formed by ‘holding\\ntogether’ do not give equal power to\\nits constituent units. Thus, all States in\\nthe Indian Union do not have identical\\npowers. Some States enjoy a special\\nstatus. Jammu and Kashmir has its own\\nConstitution. Many provisions of  the\\nIndian Constitution are not applicable\\nto this State without the approval of\\nthe State Assembly.

The\\nCentral Government resisted linguistic\\nStates for some time. But the\\nexperience has shown that the\\nformation of  linguistic States has\\nactually made the country, more united.\\nIt has also made administration easier.\\nLanguage policy\\nA second test for Indian federation is\\nthe language policy. Our Constitution\\ndid not give the status of  national\\nlanguage to any one language. Hindi was\\nidentified as the official language. But\\nHindi is the mother tongue of only\\nabout 40 per cent of  Indians. Therefore,\\nthere were many safeguards to protect\\nother languages. Besides Hindi, there are\\n21 other languages recognised as\\nScheduled Languages by the\\nConstitution. A candidate in an\\nexamination conducted for the Central\\nGovernment positions may opt to take\\nthe examination in any of these\\nlanguages. States too have their own\\nofficial languages. Much of  the\\ngovernment work takes place in the\\nofficial language of  the concerned State.\\nUnlike Sri Lanka, the leaders of our\\ncountry adopted a very cautious\\nattitude in spreading the use of Hindi.\\nAccording to the Constitution, the use\\nof  English for official purposes was to\\nstop in 1965. However, many non-\\nHindi speaking States demanded that\\nthe use of  English  continue. In Tamil\\nNadu, this movement took a violent\\nform. The Central Government\\nresponded by agreeing to continue the\\nuse of English along with Hindi for\\nofficial purposes. Many critics think\\nthat this solution favoured the English-\\nspeaking elite. Promotion of  Hindicontinues to be the official policy of\\nthe Government of  India. Promotion\\ndoes not mean that the Central\\nGovernment can impose Hindi on\\nStates where people speak a different\\nlanguage. The flexibility shown by\\nIndian political leaders helped our\\ncountry avoid the kind of  situation that\\nSri Lanka finds itself in.\\nCentre-State relations\\nRestructuring the Centre-State\\nrelations is one more way in which\\nfederalism has been strengthened in\\npractice. How the constitutional\\narrangements for sharing power work\\nin reality depends to a large extent on\\nhow the ruling parties and leaders\\nfollow these arrangements. For a long\\ntime, the same party ruled both at the\\nCentre and in most of  the States. This\\nmeant that the State governments did\\nnot exercise their rights as autonomous\\nfederal units. As and when the ruling\\nparty at the State level was different,\\nthe parties that ruled at the Centre tried\\nto undermine the power of  the States.\\nIn those days, the Central Government\\nwould often misuse the Constitution\\nto dismiss the State governments that\\nwere controlled by rival parties. This\\nundermined the spirit of  federalism.\\nAll this changed significantly\\nafter 1990. This period saw the rise\\nof regional political parties in many\\nStates of  the country. This was also\\nthe beginning of the era of\\nCOALITION  GOVERNMENTS  at the\\nCentre. Since no single party got a\\nclear majority in the Lok Sabha, the\\nmajor national parties had to enter\\ninto an alliance with many parties\\nincluding several regional parties to\\nform a government at the Centre.\\nThis led to a new culture of  power\\nsharing and respect for the autonomy\\nof  State Governments.

We have so far\\ndiscussed the two-tiers of  government\\nin our country. But a vast country like\\nIndia cannot be run only through these\\ntwo-tiers. States in India are as large as\\nindependent countries of  Europe. In\\nterms of  population, Uttar Pradesh is\\nbigger than Russia, Maharashtra is\\nabout as big as Germany. Many of\\nthese States are internally very diverse.\\nThere is thus a need for power sharing\\nwithin these States. Federal power\\nsharing in India needs another tier of\\ngovernment, below that of  the State\\ngovernments. This is the rationale for\\ndecentralisation of  power. Thus,\\nresulted a third-tier of  government,\\ncalled local government.\\nWhen power is taken away from\\nCentral and State governments and given\\nto local government, it is called\\ndecentralisation. The basic idea behind\\ndecentralisation is that there are a large\\nnumber of  problems and issues which\\nare best settled at the local level. People\\nhave better knowledge of  problems in\\ntheir localities. They also have better ideas\\non where to spend money and how to\\nmanage things more efficiently. Besides,\\nat the local level it is possible for the\\npeople to directly participate in decision\\nmaking. This helps to inculcate a habit\\nof democratic participation. Local\\ngovernment is the best way to realise  one\\nimportant principle of  democracy,\\nnamely local self-government.\\nThe need for decentralisation was\\nrecognised in our Constitution.

How do other\\nstudents in your class read this?\\nOrigins of  social differences\\nThese social differences are mostly\\nbased on accident of  birth.  Normally\\nwe don’t choose to belong to our\\ncommunity. We belong to it simply\\nbecause we were born into it. We all\\nexperience social differences based on\\naccident of  birth in our everyday lives.\\nPeople around us are male or female,\\nthey are tall and short, have different\\nkinds of complexions, or have different\\nphysical abilities or disabilities. But all\\nkinds of social differences are not\\nbased on accident of  birth. Some of\\nthe differences are based on our\\nchoices. For example, some people are\\natheists. They don’t believe in God or\\nany religion. Some people choose tofollow a religion other than the one in\\nwhich they were born. Most of  us\\nchoose what to study, which\\noccupation to take up and which\\ngames or cultural activities to take part\\nin. All these lead to formation of social\\ngroups that are based on our choices.\\nEvery social difference does not\\nlead to social division. Social\\ndifferences divide similar people from\\none another, but they also unite very\\ndifferent people. People belonging to\\ndifferent social groups share\\ndifferences and similarities cutting\\nacross the boundaries of  their groups.\\nIn the instance above, Carlos and\\nSmith were similar in one way (both\\nwere African-American) and thus\\ndifferent from Norman who was\\nwhite. But they were also all similar in\\nother ways – they were all athletes who\\nstood against racial discrimination.\\nIt is fairly common for people\\nbelonging to the same religion to feel\\nthat they do not belong to the same\\ncommunity, because their caste or sect\\nis very different. It is also possible for\\npeople from different religions to have\\nthe same caste and feel close to each\\nother. Rich and poor persons from the\\nsame family often do not keep close\\nrelations with each other for they feel\\nthey are very different. Thus, we all\\nhave more than one identity and can\\nbelong to more than one social group.\\nWe have different identities in different\\ncontexts.© Ares - Cagle Cartoons Inc.❉\\x00✁✂✄☎❛✄✆❛✝✞❉✥✟\\x00☎s✥✠✆33Overlapping and cross-cutting\\ndifferences\\nSocial division takes place when some\\nsocial dif ference ov erlaps with other\\ndifferences.  The difference between\\nthe Blacks and Whites becomes a social\\ndivision in the US because the Blacks\\ntend to be poor, homeless and\\ndiscriminated against. In our country\\nDalits  tend to be poor and landless.\\nThey often face discrimination and\\ninjustice. Situations of  this kind\\nproduce social divisions, when one\\nkind of social difference becomes\\nmore important than the other and\\npeople start feeling that they belong to\\ndifferent communities.\\nIf social differences cross cut one\\nanother, it is difficult to pit one group\\nof  people against the other. It means\\nthat groups that share a common\\ninterest on one issue are likely to be in\\ndifferent sides on a different issue.\\nConsider the cases of  Northern\\nIreland and the Netherlands. Both are\\npredominantly Christian but divided\\nbetween Catholics and Protestants. In\\nNorthern Ireland, class and religion\\noverlap with each other. If  you are\\nCatholic, you are also more likely to be\\npoor, and you may have suffered a\\nhistory of  discrimination. In the\\nNetherlands, class and religion tend to\\ncut across each other. Catholics and\\nProtestants are about equally likely to\\nbe poor or rich. The result is that\\nCatholics and Protestants have had\\nconflicts in Northern Ireland, while\\nthey do not do so in the Netherlands.\\nOverlapping social differences create\\npossibilities of  deep social divisions\\nand tensions. Cross-cutting social\\ndifferences are easier to accommodate.Social divisions of  one kind or\\nanother exist in most countries. It does\\nnot matter whether the country is small\\nor big. India is a vast country with many\\ncommunities. Belgium is a small country\\nwith many communities.

We have already\\nseen that social divisions of  one kind\\nor another exist in most countries of\\nthe world. Wherever they exist, these\\ndivisions are reflected in politics.

Social divisions affect\\nvoting in most countries. People from\\none community tend to prefer some\\nparty more than others. In many\\ncountries there are parties that focus\\nonly on one community. Yet all this\\ndoes not lead to disintegration of  the\\ncountry.\\nThree determinants\\nThree factors are crucial in deciding\\nthe outcome of politics of social\\ndivisions. First of  all the outcome\\ndepends on how people perceive their\\nidentities. If  people see their identities\\nin singular and exclusive terms, it\\nbecomes very difficult to\\naccommodate. As long as people in\\nnorthern Ireland saw themselves as\\nonly Catholic or Protestant, their\\ndifferences were difficult to reconcile.\\nIt is much easier if  the people see that\\ntheir identities are multiple and are\\ncomplementary with the national\\nidentity. A majority of  Belgians now\\nfeel that they are as much Belgian as\\nthey are Dutch or German-speaking.\\nThis helps them to stay together. This\\nis how most people in our country see\\ntheir identity: they think of  themselves\\nas Indian as well as belonging to a state\\nor a language group or a social or\\nreligious community.\\nSecond, it depends on how\\npolitical leaders raise the demands of\\nany community. It is easier to\\naccommodate demands that are within\\nthe constitutional framework and are\\nnot at the cost of  another community.In some societies of Northern Ireland, the colonies of Protestant and\\nCatholic communities are divided by walls. These walls are sometimes\\nfilled with graffiti as you can see here. The Irish Republican Army and\\nBritish Government  signed an agreement in 2005.

In\\nYugoslavia, the leaders of different\\nethnic communities presented their\\ndemands in such a way that these could\\nnot be accommodated within a single\\ncountry.\\nThird, it depends on the how the\\ngovernment reacts to demands of\\ndifferent groups. As we saw in the\\nexamples of Belgium and Sri Lanka,\\nif the rulers are willing to share power\\nand accommodate the reasonable\\ndemands of  minority community,\\nsocial divisions become less\\nthreatening for the country. But if  they\\ntry to suppress such a demand in the\\nname of  national unity, the end result\\nis often quite the opposite. Such\\nattempts at forced integration often\\nsow the seeds of  disintegration.\\nThus the assertion of social\\ndiversities in a country need not be seen\\nas a source of  danger. In a democracy,\\npolitical expression of social divisions\\nis very normal and can be healthy. This\\nallows various disadvantaged and\\nmarginal social groups to express their\\ngrievances and get the government to\\nattend to these. Expression of  various\\nkinds of social divisions in politics\\noften results in their cancelling one\\nanother out and thus reducing theirintensity. This leads to strengthening\\nof a democracy.\\nBut a positive attitude towards\\ndiversity and a willingness to\\naccommodate it do not come about\\neasily. People who feel marginalised,\\ndeprived and discriminated have to\\nfight against the injustices.

Either, one of them\\nhas to dominate the rest or they have to\\nform different nations.\\nThis belief is fundamentally flawed.\\nPeople of one religion do not have the\\nsame interests and aspirations in every\\ncontext.

Thus we have reliable inform ation on the proportion of different religious\\ncom m unities in the country and how it has changed o ver the years. The pie chart\\nbelow presents the population proportion of six m aj or religious groups in the country.\\nSince I ndependence, the total population of each gr oup has increased substantially\\nbut their proportion in the country’s population ha s not changed m uch.

Expert estim ates done\\nfor the Prim e Minister’s High Level Com m ittee (popu larly known as Sachar Com m ittee)\\nshow that the proportion of the Muslim s is expected  to go up a little, by about 3 to 4\\nper cent, in the next 50 years. I t proves that in  overall term s, the population balance\\nof different religious groups is not likely to chan ge in a big way.\\nThe sam e is true of the m ajor caste groups. The Cen sus of I ndia counts two social\\ngroups:  the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Trib es. Both these broad groups\\ninclude hundreds of castes or tribes whose nam es ar e listed in an official Schedule.\\nHence the prefix ‘Scheduled’ in their nam e. The Sch eduled Castes, com m only known\\nas Dalits , include those that were previously regarded as ‘o utcaste’ in the Hindu social\\norder and were subjected to exclusion and untouchab ility. The Scheduled Tribes, often\\nreferred to as Adivasis , include those com m unities that led a secluded lif e usually in\\nhills and forests and did not interact m uch with th e rest of society. I n 2001, the\\nScheduled Castes were 16.2 per\\ncent and the Scheduled Tribes were\\n8.2 per cent of the country’s\\npopulation.\\nThe Census does not yet count the\\nOther Backward Classes, the group\\nwe discussed in class I X.

In some situations,\\nexpression of caste differences in politics\\ngives many disadvantaged communities\\nthe space to demand their share of\\npower. In this sense-caste politics has\\nhelped people from Dalits and OBC\\ncastes to gain better access to decision\\nmaking. Several political and non-political\\norganisations have been demanding and\\nagitating for an end to discrimination\\nagainst particular castes, for more dignity\\nand more access to land, resources and\\nopportunities.\\nAt the same time exclusive attention\\nto caste can produce negative results as\\nwell. As in the case of religion, politics\\nbased on caste identity alone is not very\\nhealthy in a democracy.

Although theking formally remained the head of  the\\nstate, the real power was exercised by\\npopularly elected representatives. King\\nBirendra, who has accepted this transition\\nfrom absolute monarchy to constitutional\\nmonarchy, was killed in a mysterious\\nmassacre of the royal family in 2001.\\nKing Gyanendra, the new king of Nepal,\\nwas not prepared to accept democratic\\nrule. He took advantage of the weakness\\nand unpopularity of the democratically\\nelected government.

People defied\\ncurfew and took to the streets. The\\nsecurity forces found themselves unable\\nto take on more than a lakh people who\\ngathered almost every day to demand\\nrestoration of  democracy.

The World Bank pressurised the\\ngovernment to give up its control of\\nmunicipal water supply. The government\\nsold these rights for the city of\\nCochabamba to a multi-national\\ncompany (MNC). The company\\nimmediately increased the price of water\\nby four times. Many people received\\nmonthly water bill of Rs 1000 in a\\ncountry where average income is around\\nRs 5000 a month. This led to a\\nspontaneous popular protest.\\nIn January 2000, a new alliance of\\nlabour, human rights and community\\nleaders organised a successful four-day\\ngeneral strike in the city. The government\\nagreed to negotiate and the strike was\\ncalled off. Yet nothing happened. The\\npolice resorted to brutal repression when\\nthe agitation was started again in February.\\nAnother strike followed in April and the\\ngovernment imposed martial law. But the\\npower of the people forced the officials\\nof the MNC to flee the city and made\\nthe government concede to all the\\ndemands of  the protesters. The contract\\nwith the MNC was cancelled and water\\nsupply was restored to the municipality\\nat old rates. This came to be known as\\nBolivia’s water war.Democracy and popular\\nstruggles\\nThese two stories are from very different\\ncontexts. The movement in Nepal was\\nto establish democracy, while the struggle\\nin Bolivia involved claims on an elected,\\ndemocratic government. The popular\\nstruggle in Bolivia was about one specific\\npolicy, while the  struggle in Nepal was\\nabout the foundations of  the country’s\\npolitics. Both these struggles were\\nsuccessful but their impact was at\\ndifferent levels.\\nDespite these differences, both the\\nstories share some elements which are\\nrelevant to the study of the past and\\nfuture of  democracies. Both these are\\ninstances of political conflict that led to\\npopular struggles. In both cases the\\nstruggle involved mass mobilisation.\\nPublic demonstration of mass support\\nclinched the dispute. Finally, both\\ninstances involved critical role of political\\norganisations. If  you recall the first\\nchapter of class IX textbook, this is how\\ndemocracy has evolved all over the\\nworld.  We can therefore draw a few\\nconclusions from these examples:✠Democracy evolves through\\npopular str uggles . It is possib le that some\\nsignificant decisions may take place\\nthrough consensus and may not involve\\nany conflict at all. But that would be an\\nexception. Defining moments of\\ndemocracy usually involve conflict\\nbetween those groups who have\\nexercised power and those who aspire\\nfor a share in power. These moments\\ncome when the country is going through\\ntransition to democracy, expansion of\\ndemocracy or deepening of  democracy.✠Democratic conflict is resolved\\nthrough mass mobilisation. Sometimes\\nAre you\\nsuggesting that\\nstrike, dharna,\\nbandh and\\ndem onstration\\nare a good thing?\\nI  thought it\\nhappened only in\\nour country,\\nbecause we are\\nnot a m ature\\ndem ocracy yet.P♦\\x00✁✂✄☎✆t☎✁✝✝✂✞✟✄❛✠✡♦✈✞❡✞❛t✟61\\nDoes it m ean that\\nwhichever side\\nm anages to\\nm obilise a bigger\\ncrowd gets away\\nwith whatever it\\nwants?

But when\\nthere is a deep dispute, very often these\\ninstitutions themselves get involved in the\\ndispute. The resolution has to come\\nfrom outside, from the people.☛These conflicts and mobilisations are\\nbased on new political organisations.\\nTrue, there is an element of  spontaneity\\nin all such historic moments. But the\\nspontaneous public participation\\nbecomes effective with the help of\\norganised politics. There can be many\\nagencies of  organised politics. These\\ninclude political parties, pressure groups\\nand movement groups.\\nI n 1984, the Karnataka governm ent set up a com pany called Karnataka Pulpwood\\nLim ited.

They\\nmay not have the desire, the need or\\nthe skills to take part in direct political\\nactivity other than voting.\\nThere are many indirect ways in\\nwhich people can get governments to\\nlisten to their demands or their point of\\nview. They could do so by forming an\\norganisation and undertaking activities to\\npromote their interest or their viewpoint.\\nThese are called interest groups or\\npressure groups.

Trade unions, business\\nassociations and professional (lawyers,\\ndoctors, teachers, etc.) bodies are some\\nexamples of this type. They are sectional\\nbecause they represent a section of\\nsociety: workers, employees, business-\\npersons, industrialists, followers of a\\nreligion, caste group, etc. Their principal\\nconcern is the betterment and well being\\nof their members, not society in general.\\nSometimes these organisations are\\nnot about representing the interest of one\\nsection of  society. They represent some\\ncommon or general interest that needs\\nto be defended. The members of the\\norganisation may not benefit from the\\ncause that the organisation represents. The\\nBolivian organisation FEDECOR is an\\nexample of that kind of an organisation.\\nIn the context of Nepal, we noted the\\nparticipation of human rights\\norganisations. We read about these\\norganisations in class IX.\\nThese second type of groups are\\ncalled promotional groups or public\\ninterest groups. They promote collective\\nrather than selective good. They aim to\\nhelp groups other than their own\\nmembers. For example, a group fighting\\nagainst bonded labour fights not for itself\\nbut for those who are suffering under\\nsuch bondage. In some instances the\\nmembers of a public interest group may\\nundertake activity that benefits them as\\nwell as others too.

Most of\\nthe movements are issue specific\\nmovements that seek to achieve a single\\nobjective within a limited time frame.\\nOthers are more general or generic\\nmovements that seek to achieve a broad\\ngoal in the very long term.\\nThe Nepalese movement for\\ndemocracy arose with the specific\\nobjective of  reversing the king’s orders\\nthat led to suspension of  democracy. In\\nIndia, Narmada Bachao Andolan is a\\ngood example of this kind of\\nmovement. The movement started withthe specific issue of the people displaced\\nby the creation of Sardar Sarovar\\ndam on the Narmada river. Its objective\\nwas to stop the dam from being\\nconstructed. Gradually it became a\\nwider movement that questioned all\\nsuch big dams and the model of\\ndevelopment that required such dams.\\nMovements of this kind tend to have a\\nclear leadership and some organisation.\\nBut their active life is usually short.\\nThese single-issue movements can\\nbe contrasted with movements that are\\nlong term and involve more than one\\nissue. The environmental movement and\\nthe women’s movement are examples\\nof  such movements. There is no single\\norganisation that controls or guides such\\nmovements.  Environmental movement\\nis a label for a large number of\\norganisations and issue-specific\\nmovements.

More\\nthan loyalty to party principles and\\npolicies, personal loyalty to the leader\\nbecomes more important.\\nThe second challenge of dynastic\\nsuccession is related to the first one. Since\\nmost political parties do not practice\\nopen and transparent procedures for\\ntheir functioning, there are very few ways\\nfor an ordinary worker to rise to the top\\nin a party. Those who happen to be the\\nleaders are in a position of unfair\\nadvantage to favour people close to\\nthem or even their family members. In\\nmany parties, the top positions are always\\ncontrolled by members of  one family.\\nThis is unfair to other members of that\\nparty. This is also bad for democracy,\\nsince people who do not have adequate\\nexperience or popular support come to\\noccupy positions of  power. This\\ntendency is present in some measure all\\nover the world, including in some of\\nthe older democracies.  The third challenge is about the\\ngrowing role of money and muscle\\npower  in parties, especially during\\nelections. Since parties are focussed only\\non winning elections, they tend to use\\nshort-cuts to win elections. They tend to\\nnominate those candidates who have or\\ncan raise lots of money. Rich people and\\ncompanies who give funds to the parties\\ntend to have influence on the policies and\\ndecisions of  the party. In some cases,\\nparties support criminals who can win\\nelections. Democrats all over the world\\nare worried about the increasing role of\\nrich people and big companies in\\ndemocratic politics.\\nThe fourth challenge is that very\\noften parties do not seem to offer a\\nmeaningful choice  to the voters. In\\norder to offer meaningful choice, parties\\nmust be significantly different. In recent\\nyears there has been a decline in the\\nideological differences among parties in\\nmost parts of  the world.

This was in Chapter 2 of\\nClass IX textbook. It emerged from that\\nconversation that democracy is a better\\nform of  government when compared\\nwith dictatorship or any other alternative.\\nWe felt that democracy was better\\nbecause it:✖Promotes equality among citizens;✖Enhances the dignity of the\\nindividual;✖Improves the quality of decision-\\nmaking;✖Provides a method to resolve\\nconflicts; and✖Allows room to correct mistakes.\\nAre these expectations realised under\\ndemocracies? When we talk to people\\naround us, most of them support\\ndemocracy against other alternatives,\\nsuch as rule by a monarch or military or\\nreligious leaders . But not so many of\\nthem would be satisfied with the\\ndemocracy in practice. So we face a\\ndilemma: democracy is seen to be goodin principle, but felt to be not so good in\\nits practice. This dilemma invites us to\\nthink hard about the outcomes of\\ndemocracy. Do w e prefer democracy\\nonly for moral reasons? Or are there\\nsome prudential reasons to support\\ndemocracy too?\\nOver a hundred countries of the\\nworld today claim and practice some\\nkind of democratic politics: they have\\nformal constitutions, they hold elections,\\nthey have parties and they guarantee rights\\nof  citizens. While these features are\\ncommon to most of them, these\\ndemocracies are very much different\\nfrom each other in terms of  their social\\nsituations, their economic achievements\\nand their cultures. Clearly, what may be\\nachieved or not achieved under each of\\nthese democracies will be very different.\\nBut is there something that we can expect\\nfrom every democracy, just because it is\\ndemocracy?\\nOur interest in and fascination for\\ndemocracy often pushes us into taking a\\nposition that democracy can address all\\nsocio-economic and political problems.\\nIf some of our expectations are not met,\\nwe start blaming the idea of  democracy.\\nOr, we start doubting if we are living in\\na democracy. The first step towards\\nthinking carefully about the outcomes\\nof democracy is to recognise that\\ndemocracy is just a form of government.\\nIt can only create conditions for achieving\\nsomething. The citizens have to take\\nadvantage of those conditions and\\nachieve those goals. Let us examine some\\nof the things we can reasonably expect\\nfrom democracy and examine the record\\nof  democracy.\\nDid we reach\\nthese\\nconclusions in\\nMadam  Lyngdoh’s\\nclass? I  loved\\nthat class\\nbecause\\nstudents were\\nnot being\\ndictated any\\nconclusions.© RK Laxman - Brushing up the years❖\\x00✁✂✄☎✆✝✄✞✟✆☎✄✂✠✡✂☛91\\n❆ ☞ ☞ ✌ ✍ ✎ ✏✑ ✒ ✓ ✔ ✕ ✖ ✔ ✗✘ ✌ ✎ ✗ ✙ ✚ ✔ ✑ ✎ ✛ ✓ ✔ ✜ ✙ ✏✙ ✢ ✑ ✏✔ ✜ ✌ ✚ ✔ ✖ ✎ ✢ ✔ ✎ ✏\\nThere are some things that democracy\\nmust provide. In a democracy, we are\\nmost concerned with ensuring that\\npeople will have the right to choose their\\nrulers and people will have control over\\nthe rulers. Whenever possible and\\nnecessary, citizens should be able to\\nparticipate in decision making, that affects\\nthem all. Therefore, the most basic\\noutcome of democracy should be that\\nit produces a government that is\\naccountable to the citizens, and\\nresponsive to the needs and expectations\\nof  the citizens.\\nBefore we go into this question, we\\nface another common question: Is the\\ndemocratic government efficient? Is it\\neffective? Some people think that\\ndemocracy produces less effective\\ngovernment. It is, of course, true that\\nnon-democratic rulers do not have to\\nbother about deliberation in assemblies or\\nworry about majorities and public opinion.\\nSo, they can be very quick and efficient in\\ndecision making and implementation.\\nDemocracy is based on the idea of\\ndeliberation and negotiation. So, some delay\\nis bound to take place. Does that make\\ndemocratic government inefficient?\\nLet us think in terms of costs.\\nImagine a government that may take\\ndecisions very fast. But it may take\\ndecisions that are not accepted by the\\npeople and may therefore face problems.\\nIn contrast, the democratic government\\nwill take more time to follow\\nprocedures before arriving at a decision.\\nBut because it has followed procedures,\\nits decisions may be both more\\nacceptable to the people and more\\neffective. So, the cost of  time that\\ndemocracy pays is perhaps worth it.Now look at the other side –\\ndemocracy ensures that decision making\\nwill be based on norms and procedures.\\nSo, a citizen who wants to know if  a\\ndecision was taken through the correct\\nprocedures can find this out. She has the\\nright and the means to examine the\\nprocess of  decision making. This is\\nknown as transparency. This factor is\\noften missing from a non-democratic\\ngovernment. Therefore, when we are\\ntrying to find out the outcomes of\\ndemocracy, it is right to expect\\ndemocracy to produce a government\\nthat follows procedures and is\\naccountable to the people. We can also\\nexpect that the democratic government\\ndevelops mechanisms for citizens to hold\\nthe government accountable and\\nmechanisms for citizens to take part in\\ndecision making whenever they think fit.\\nIf you wanted to measure\\ndemocracies on the basis of this\\nexpected outcome, you would look for\\nthe following practices and institutions:\\nregular, free and fair elections; open\\npublic debate on major policies and\\n© Mike Keefe  - Cagle Cartoons Inc.\\nCan you think of what\\nand how the\\ngovernment knows\\nabout you and your\\nfamily (for example\\nration cards and\\nvoter identity cards)?\\nWhat are the sources\\nof information for you\\nabout the\\ngovernment?Governmental Secrecy92\\n❉\\x00✁✂✄☎❛✆✝✄✞✂♦✝✆✝✄✟\\nSo, the best\\noutcom e of\\ndem ocracy is\\nthat it is a\\ndem ocracy!

The actual performance\\nof democracies shows a mixed record\\non this. Democracies have had greater\\nsuccess in setting up regular and free\\nelections and in setting up conditions for\\nopen public debate. But most\\ndemocracies fall short of elections that\\nprovide a fair chance to everyone and in\\nsubjecting every decision to public debate.\\nDemocratic governments do not have a\\nvery good record when it comes to\\nsharing information with citizens. All one\\ncan say in favour of democratic regimes\\nis that they are much better than any\\nnon-democratic regime in these respects.\\nIn substantive terms it may be\\nreasonable to expect from democracy a\\ngovernment that is attentive to the needs\\nand demands of the people and is largely\\nfree of corruption. The record of\\ndemocracies is not impressive on these\\ntwo counts. Democracies often frustrate\\nthe needs of the people and often ignore\\nthe demands of a majority of itspopulation. The routine tales of\\ncorruption are enough to convince us that\\ndemocracy is not free of this evil. At the\\nsame time, there is nothing to show that\\nnon-democracies are less corrupt or\\nmore sensitive to the people.\\nThere is one respect in which\\ndemocratic government is certainly\\nbetter than its alternatives: democratic\\ngovernment is legitimate government.\\nIt may be slow, less efficient, not always\\nvery responsive or clean. But a\\ndemocratic government is people’s own\\ngovernment. That is why there is an\\noverwhelming support for the idea of\\ndemocracy all over the world. As the\\naccompanying evidence from South\\nAsia shows, the support exists in\\ncountries with democratic regimes as\\nwell as countries without democratic\\nregimes. People wish to be ruled by\\nrepresentatives elected by them. They\\nalso believe that democracy is suitable\\nfor their country.

There we tracked the\\nexpansion of democracy all over the world in the last\\nhundred years. Our reading thereafter has confirmed\\nour initial impression: democracy is the dominant form\\nof government in the contemporary world. It does\\nnot face a serious challenger or rival. Yet our exploration\\nof the various dimensions of democratic politics has\\nshown us something else as well. The promise of\\ndemocracy is far from realised anywhere in the world.\\nDemocracy does not have a challenger, but that does\\nnot mean that it does not face any challenges.\\nAt different points in this tour of  democracy, we\\nhave noted the serious challenges that democracy faces\\nall over the world. A challenge is not just any problem.\\nWe usually call only those difficulties a ‘challenge’ which\\nare significant and which can be overcome. A challenge\\nis a difficulty that carries within it an opportunity for\\nprogress. Once we overcome a challenge we go up to\\na higher level than before.\\nDifferent countries face different kinds of\\nchallenges. Can you recall the map of  democratic\\ngovernments in the year 2000 that was included in your\\ntextbook? At least one fourth of the globe is still not\\nunder democratic government. The challenge for\\ndemocracy in these parts of the world is very stark.These countries face the foundational challenge  of\\nmaking the transition to democracy and then instituting\\ndemocratic government. This involves bringing down\\nthe existing non-democratic regime, keeping military\\naway from controlling government and establishing a\\nsovereign and functional state.\\nMost of the established democracies face the\\nchallenge of expansion. This involves applying the\\nbasic principle of democratic government across all\\nthe regions, different social groups and various\\ninstitutions. Ensuring greater power to local\\ngovernments, extension of federal principle to all the\\nunits of the federation, inclusion of women and\\nminority groups, etc., falls under this challenge. This\\nalso means that less and less decisions should remain\\noutside the arena of democratic control. Most\\ncountries including India and other democracies like\\nthe US face this challenge.\\nThe third challenge of deepening of democracy\\nis faced by every democracy in one form or another.\\nThis involves strengthening of the institutions and\\npractices of  democracy. This should happen in such a\\nway that people can realise their expectations of\\ndemocracy. But ordinary people have different\\nexpectations from democracy in different societies.\\nTherefore, this challenge takes different meanings and\\npaths in different parts of  the world. In general terms,\\nit usually means strengthening those institutions\\nthat help people’s participation and control.\\nThis requires an attempt to bring down the\\ncontrol and influence of the rich and\\npowerful people in making governmental\\ndecision.\\nWe have noted or hinted at these\\nchallenges in all the various examples and\\nstories that we studied in our textbook of\\nClass IX and in the earlier chapters of this\\nbook. Let us go back to all the major stops\\nin our tour of  democracy, refresh our\\nmemory and note down the challenges\\nthat democracy faces in each of these.❈\\x00✁✂✂✄☎✆✄✝✞✟✠✄✡✟☛☞✁☛✌103\\n❉ ✍ ✎✎✏ ✑ ✏ ✒ ✓ ✔ ✕ ✒ ✓✏ ✖ ✓✗ ✱ ✘ ✍ ✎✎✏ ✑ ✏ ✒ ✓ ✔ ✙ ✚ ✛ ✛ ✏ ✒ ✜ ✏ ✗\\nEach of  these cartoons represents a challenge to democracy.

As mentioned above, we discuss\\nchallenges only because we think these can be\\novercome. Generally all the suggestions or proposals\\nabout overcoming various challenges to democracy\\nare called ‘democracy reform’ or ‘political reform’.\\nWe are not going to give here a list of  desirable\\npolitical reforms, for there cannot be any such list. If\\nall the countries do not have the same challenges, it\\nfollows that everyone cannot follow the same recipe\\nof  political reforms. We cannot prescribe a procedure\\nfor car repair without knowing which model the car\\nis, what the defect is and what tools are available,\\nwhere the car has broken down, etc.\\nCan we at least have a list of such reforms for our\\ncountry in today’s context? We can develop some\\nproposals for reforms at the national level. But the\\nreal challenge of  reforms may not lie at the national\\nlevel. Some of the crucial questions need to be thought\\nat the State or local level. Besides, such a list may\\nbecome irrelevant after some time. So, instead of  that\\nlet us think of some broad guidelines that can be kept\\nin mind while devising ways and means for political\\nreforms in India:✛It is very tempting to think of legal ways of\\nreforming politics, to think of new laws to ban\\nundesirable things. But this temptation needs to be\\nresisted. No doubt, law has an important role to play\\nin political reform. Carefully devised changes in law\\ncan help to discourage wrong political practices and\\nencourage good ones. But legal-constitutional changes\\nby themselves cannot overcome challenges to\\ndemocracy. This is like the rules of  cricket. A change\\nin rules for LBW decisions helped to reduce negative\\nbatting tactics. But no one would ever think that the\\nquality of cricket could be improved mainly through\\nchanges in the rules. This is to be done mainly by the\\nplayers, coaches and administrators. Similarly,\\ndemocratic reforms are to be carried out mainly bypolitical activists, parties, movements and politically\\nconscious citizens.✛Any legal change must carefully look at what results\\nit will ha ve on politics . Sometimes the results may be\\ncounter-productive. For example, many states have\\nbanned people who have more than two children\\nfrom contesting panchayat elections. This has resulted\\nin denial of democratic opportunity to many poor\\nand women, which was not intended. Generally, laws\\nthat seek to ban something are not very successful in\\npolitics. Laws that give political actors incentives to do\\ngood things have more chances of  working. The best\\nlaws are those which empower people to carry out\\ndemocratic reforms. The Right to Information Act is\\na good example of a law that empowers the people\\nto find out what is happening in government and act\\nas watchdogs of  democracy. Such a law helps to\\ncontrol corruption and supplements the existing laws\\nthat banned corruption and imposed strict penalties.✛Democratic reforms are to be brought about\\nprincipally through political practice. Therefore, the\\nmain focus of  political refo rms should be on ways to\\nstrengthen democratic practice. As we discussed in the\\nchapter on political parties, the most important concern\\nshould be to increase and improve the quality of\\npolitical participation by ordinary citizens.✛Any proposal for political reforms should think not\\nonly about what is a good solution but also about who\\nwill implement it and ho w. It is not v ery wise to think\\nthat the legislatures will pass legislations that go against\\nthe interest of  all the political parties and MPs. But\\nmeasures that rely on democratic movements, citizens’\\norganisations and the media are likely to succeed.\\nLet us keep these general guidelines in mind and\\nlook at some specific instances of challenges to\\ndemocracy that require some measure of reform. Let\\nus try to come up with some concrete proposals of\\nreform.❈\\x00✁✂✂✄☎✆✄✝✞✟✠✄✡✟☛☞✁☛✌109Here are some challenges that require political reforms.

They live\\nin a town, carry out private practice and visit the village\\nwhere they are posted only once or twice in the entire\\nmonth. Villagers have to travel to towns and pay very\\nhigh fee to private doctors even for common ailments.\\nReform proposals:✍The government should make it compulsory\\nfor the doctors to live in the village where they are\\nposted,  otherwise their service should be ter minated.✍District administration and police should carry\\nout surprise raids to check the attendance of the\\ndoctor s.✍Village panchayat should be given the power to\\nwrite the annual report of the doctor which should\\nbe read out in the gr am sabha meeting.✍Problems like this can be solved only if Uttar\\nPradesh is split into several smaller states which can\\nbe administer ed more efficientl y.Political funding\\nChallenge:\\nOn an average, every candidate who contested the\\nlast Lok Sabha elections owned a property of more\\nthan Rs one crore.

Do you remember\\nthat? This is what Chapter 2 of your textbook said last\\nyear: democracy is a form of  government in which\\nthe rulers are elected by the people. We then looked at\\nmany cases and expanded the definition slightly to add\\nsome qualifications:✚the rulers elected by the people must take all the\\nmajor decisions;✚elections must offer a choice and fair opportunity\\nto the people to change the current rulers;✚this choice and opportunity should be available to\\nall the people on an equal basis; and✚the exercise of this choice must lead to a\\ngovernment limited by basic rules of the constitution\\nand citizens’ rights .\\nYou ma y have felt disappointed that the definition\\ndid not refer to any high ideals that we associate with\\ndemocracy. But in operational terms, we deliberately\\nstarted with a minimalist but clear definition of\\ndemocracy. It allowed us to make a clear distinction\\nbetween democratic and non-democratic regimes.\\nYou may have noticed that in the course of  our\\ndiscussions of various aspects of democratic\\ngovernment and politics, we have gone beyond that\\ndefinition:✚We discussed democratic rights at length and noted\\nthat these rights are not limited to the right to vote,\\nstand in elections and f orm political organisations. We\\ndiscussed some social and economic rights that a\\ndemocracy should offer to its citizens.✚We have taken up power sharing as the spirit of\\ndemocracy and discussed how power sharing between\\ngovernments and social groups is necessary in\\na democra cy.✚We saw how democracy cannot be the brute rule\\nof majority and how a respect for minority voice is\\nnecessary for democrac y.\\n✚Our discussion of democracy has gone beyond\\nthe g overnment and its activities. We discussed how\\neliminating discrimination based on caste, religion and\\ngender is important in a democracy.✚Finally, we have had some discussion about some\\noutcomes that one can expect from a democracy.\\nIn doing so , we have not gone against the definition\\nof  democracy offered last year. We began then with a\\ndefinition of what is the minimum a country must\\nhave to be called a democracy.
